# SQL Data Cleaning and EDA Projects
SQL Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with MySQL
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Project 1: Data Cleaning

This project involves cleaning the layoffs dataset by performing the following tasks:

1. *Removing Duplicates:* Identifying and removing duplicate rows from the dataset.
2. *Standardizing the Data:* Standardizing company names, industry names, and country names.
3. *Handling Null or Blank Values:* Populating missing values for the industry column and removing rows with null values for critical columns.
4. *Removing Irrelevant Columns:* Safeguarding the data by creating a new table mirroring the original one and deleting unnecessary rows.

The project includes SQL queries to execute each task and ensure that the dataset is clean and ready for analysis.

## Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project involves conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the cleaned layoffs dataset. It includes the following analyses:

1. Analyzing layoffs by industry, country, location, and stage.
2. Determining the date range of the dataset and analyzing layoffs by date, year, and month.
3. Calculating rolling totals of layoffs by month to observe trends over time.
4. Analyzing layoffs by company and year, identifying the top companies with the highest total layoffs each year.

The project aims to gain insights into the dataset, identify patterns and trends, and provide valuable information for decision-making and further analysis.
